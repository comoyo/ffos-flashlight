# Flashlight app for Firefox OS

Works on Firefox OS 1.1 and higher. Use the app manager to push it
to your device.

From FFOS 2.0 the mozCamera API is no longer certified, so you can
just grab one from the marketplace.

App icon comes from http://www.iconarchive.com/show/oxygen-icons-by-oxygen-icons.org/Apps-preferences-web-browser-cache-icon.html.
